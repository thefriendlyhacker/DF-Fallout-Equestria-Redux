Version: .03

Changelog: 
 V.03
   Added parasprite, Ursa, Apple Ent, Banana Ent, and Tank Sprites
   Added a standard sprite for Griffons, Buffalo, Diamond Dogs, and Zebra
 V.02
   Added names to all the layers in the PSD


Note: these tiles are 18x18 as I made them to be usable with Ironhands .60 Graphic pack.


Installation: Place Pony_little.png, P_Crit.png, graphics_Pony_Little.txt, and graphics_Pony_Creatures.txt in your raw\graphics folder. To install this for already running save games, place this in your the raw\graphics folder located in your save file.


I have included the PSD. Feel free to use it and customize it to your liking. Some of my sprites kind of suck and none of them were made specifically for DF so I would love to see some improvement.

Have Fun,
TecknoJock
