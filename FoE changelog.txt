0.41.7
major changes
- added combat/pump shotguns, buckshot and slugs
- added many energy weapons, energy weapon ammo and appropriate reactions, and removed old robronco energy weapon parts
- added canister rounds for AMRs - basically a high velocity buckshot round
- renamed ranged skills. Skills now follow the fallout style small guns/big guns/energy weapons convention.
- Buckshot and canister rounds have inherently higher accuracy (blasts of pellets are more likely to connect than a single bullet)
- changed ripper rifle to ripper shotgun, leaving the chain rifle as the combo medium caliber weapon
- minigun now shoots proper medium caliber bullets, firing about 90 rounds per burst with a long cooldown
- laser and plasma weapons now fire proper cutting energy blasts. Lasers have higher rof but suck against armor, plasma go through steel but have slow rof
- other interaction based bullet weapons now shoot actual bullets
- added the axe and chain axe
- consolidated melee skills.  All maces are now hammers, all daggers(except the knife) are now swords, all pikes are spears

minor tweaks
- giant cave spiders now use tough chitin templates
- made soap and tallow generic
- did some cleaning up of template mats (removing unused leather/parchment and such). Will do more later.
- tweaked pellets,since they are now pulling double duty as buckshot 
- removed adv specific pellets
- added force batons to a couple of salvage boxes
- upped amount of pellets from MWT reaction
- added orewood processing to prism smelter
- strand extraction removed, adamantine cloth created by converting bars to thread at forge.
- hellhounds now have internal graspers in their hands.  This allows their hands to be protected by combat armor (since stables can't make gloves)
- made some changes to griffon/stable pony caste skills, to go along with weapon skill changes
- the hunting rifle now uses crossbow(gunner), to go along with planned bow=heavy weapons, blowgun=energy/special weapons
- increased the ammo cost of the minigun battle saddle
- spear ponies now use the pike pony sprite (because I like how it looks better)
- hacksaw is now not a serious weapon.  On the bright side, it should be cheaper to embark with if you just want something to cut trees with.

bug fixes
- fixed bad header on reaction_bowyer file (probably wasn't doing anything, but still)
- fixed order of griffon body preventing body armor from covering lower body.
- fixed a couple of bugs in the ranged-module scripts
- fixed broken millable reactions
- fixed bug in corn.  It should *hopefully* show up now.

- removed some duplicate pony graphics raws

- SMGs and automatic rifles
- added Glaive and Ripsaw Glaive, using the piker skill, and the Storm Glaive, a Ripsaw Glaive/twin linked SMG hybrid
- added Tissue Layer Color Modifier randomization script to work around DF genetics, so all ponies won't have identical coat colors and lots of CM duplication


minor tweaks
- cut killing joke gender changing interactions until I can be bothered going over all the interactions converting them to the new stable caste system (which may be never)
- added reanimated griffon sprite
- made royal jelly and honey solid at room temp
- alteration school's time stutter/stop give noexert for their duration
- tweaked preset worldgen cavern heights.
- tweaked some ranged weapon velocity/projectile sizes
- tweaked amr mat size
- gun making reactions now all use steel
- redid ammo reactions, they also produce more ammo for the same metal input
- cut projectile disassembly reactions until I get around to overhauling them
- cut strand extraction entirely, metal thread making now done through the forge from wafers/bars
- bismuth bronze can no longer be used for weapons, because it was annoying and redundant

- sver's combat overhaul mat changes integrated into mod - no more glass spinal cords
- more leather mod integrated - lots of leather/parchment from large creatures

- removed subterranean biome from slaves, since the cave animals hack is no longer needed thanks to [ANIMAL]
